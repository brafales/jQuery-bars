This is a simple jQuery plugin based on the jQuery UI Progressbar widget.
It allows you to create horizontal colored bars which can be animated, and
allowing you to determine the width of the bar, the background and foreground
colors, and the animation duration.
This plugin can be useful, for example, to draw bars in a bar chart fashion.
It differs from Progressbar in the fact that allows you to animate the bar
and does not depend on jQuery UI, so you can choose your own css for it.
To see usage examples, look at the test folder.

It has been tested with jQuery 1.4 and 1.5
